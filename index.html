            <p>
                I am Naileth Rivero, a front-end developer and English as a foreign
                language teacher, passionate about languages and obsessed with
                learning new things. My insatiable thirst for knowledge and
                never-ending desire to learn led me to venture into technology where I
                have discovered a whole new world full of opportunities and challenges
                that encouraged me to become an even better version of myself day
                after day. As a language learner, I know how difficult it can be to
                learn a new language, and as a front-end developer, I would like to
                create an app to make the language learning process easier.
